                <h1>Silicon Chip Implant Marvel</h1>
                <p>A group of analysts drove by Chandan Sen at the Indiana University School of Medicine, is moving a new nanochip gadget,
                    which can reinvent skin cells in the body to turn out to be fresh blood vessels and nerve cells, out of the model stage.
                    The IU team's approach is to forgo the laboratory and turn the human body into its own cell programmer using a technology
                    called tissue nano-transfection. This uses a silicon nanochip that has been printed to include channels ending in an array
                    of micro-needles. On top of the chip is a rectangular cargo container, which holds specific genes.</p>
                <p>Moved by an engaged electric charge, these qualities are acquainted with the ideal profundity in the living tissue and adjust
                    the cells, changing over the area into a little bioreactor that reconstructs the cells to become various types of cells or multicellular
                    designs, like veins or nerves, without the requirement for intricate lab strategies or dangerous infection move frameworks. When created,
                    these phones and tissues can assist with fixing harm both locally or in different pieces of the body, remembering for the cerebrum.</p>

                <h1>Legal Implications, IU School Of Medicine </h1>
                <p>The technology has been under development for over five years, and the IU team is now focusing on going beyond prototyping to making the nanochip
                    a practical concern that can be used in clinical settings. This includes securing US FDA approval next year, which would open up the potential for
                    clinical research in people. Potential applications in civilian and military medicine include repairing brain damage resulting from a stroke or
                    reversing nerve damage caused by diabetes.</p>

            <p>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. - - An interdisciplinary group drove by Indiana University social neuroscientist Anne Krendl was granted $3.5 million by the National
                Institutes of Health to explore a peculiarity with significant guarantee for the treatment of Alzheimer's infection: that the social connectedness of
                more seasoned grown-ups predicts their weakness to Alzheimer's and general mental deterioration.</p>
